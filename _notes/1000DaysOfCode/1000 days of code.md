- Notable articles: 
	-   [The Thirty Minute Rule](https://daniel.feldroy.com/posts/thirty-minute-rule) - by Daniel Roy Greenfeld. He talks about a rule he uses about getting stuck and when to ask for help. I sometimes find it tricky to get the right balance between figuring something out myself and asking for help, so I think this will be a good rule of thumb to keep in mind!
	-   [A Dev's Thoughts on Developer Productivity](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/developer-productivity-thoughts) - an interesting visualised perspective on dev productivity.

Configured the Next.js project files (created with create next app with TypeScript), reading some of [their documentation on creating a Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app). Installed Tailwind and created a super simple 'coming soon' page to get the ball rolling and just have something displayed on the site in the meantime while building. Deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) which was super simple - [thewinjar.app](https://thewinjar.app)

<hr>

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a library for the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language.
- Roughly scoped out some pages for [[front end]] related topics.
- Updated my [GitHub README](https://github.com/nicoleanalisecox) to have a cool isometric contributions visual. 😅  This is from the [lowlighter/metrics repo](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics), which I found on a repo that I saw a colleague had starred.

**🐙   day 496 / 1000 — daily.dev reading**

-   Installed the [daily.dev extension](https://api.daily.dev/get?r=nicoleisxyz) which curates tech related articles, and well, read some!  Thought I'd check it out after seeing the lovely Emma W post about it on Twitter.

**🐙   day 486-495 / 1000 — redux & new portfolio website build & launch**

-   Built a [new portfolio site](https://nicoleis.xyz). I have wanted to update my portfolio for a while. My existing one was a [simple HTML/CSS portfolio](https://www.nicoleanalisecox.dev). I wanted to have my portfolio and blog within one site, and went with using [[Gatsby]] with [Ghost integrated as a headless-CMS](https://ghost.org/docs/jamstack/) so I could fetch my existing blog posts and still use their UI to write more. I styled the site with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (using it for the first time) and used Headless UI for the navigation menu. Really happy with how it turned out and have had some positive comments about the design!
-   I also used [Polypane](https://polypane.app/) during the development and it made checking responsiveness over different screen sizes so much faster! Cool debugging features too.
-   At work: writing [[Redux]] selectors for the first time, to wire up new components on the front-end to get data from the backend. Selectors are basically functions that take in the latest state from the Redux store and will return us something based on that data. 

I shared my site on Twitter and the Gatsby.js retweeted it!

Edit: They FEATURED my website in the Gatsby Gazette newsletter for May 2022!!! So cool!
