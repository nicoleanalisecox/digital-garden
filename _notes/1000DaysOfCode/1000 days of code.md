### 👩🏻‍💻 Logs


**🐙  day 498 / 1000 — digital garden**

- Configured & launched digital garden - see [[setting up my digital garden]]. Built on top of a Jekyll based template.
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a library for the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language.
- Roughly scoped out some pages for [[front end]] related topics.
- Updated my [GitHub README](https://github.com/nicoleanalisecox) to have a cool isometric contributions visual. 😅  This is from the [lowlighter/metrics repo](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics), which I found on a repo that I saw a colleague had starred.

**🐙   day 497 / 1000 — daily.dev reading**

- Notable articles: 
	-   [JavaScript Knowledge Map](https://learnjavascript.online/knowledge-map.html) - A breakdown of JavaScript topics. I love overview knowledge-y things like this. 
	-   [Terminal for JS devs](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/terminal-for-js-devs/) - Josh Comeau explains terminal commands in a nice way.

Noticed they have a lil' daily dev card you can share too, cute

**🐙   day 496 / 1000 — daily.dev reading**

-   Installed the [daily.dev extension](https://api.daily.dev/get?r=nicoleisxyz) which curates tech related articles, and well, read some!  Thought I'd check it out after seeing the lovely Emma W post about it on Twitter.

-   Notable articles: 
	-   [The Code Review Pyramid](https://www.morling.dev/blog/the-code-review-pyramid/) - an interesting read / cool visual for potential questions to think about during code reviews.
	-   [App Ideas Collection](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) - a list by Florin Pop of app ideas, sorted by skill level - there's loads!

**🐙   day 486-495 / 1000 — redux & new portfolio website build & launch**

-   Built a [new portfolio site](https://nicoleis.xyz). I have wanted to update my portfolio for a while. My existing one was a [simple HTML/CSS portfolio](https://www.nicoleanalisecox.dev). I wanted to have my portfolio and blog within one site, and went with using [[Gatsby]] with [Ghost integrated as a headless-CMS](https://ghost.org/docs/jamstack/) so I could fetch my existing blog posts and still use their UI to write more. I styled the site with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (using it for the first time) and used Headless UI for the navigation menu. Really happy with how it turned out and have had some positive comments about the design!
-   I also used [Polypane](https://polypane.app/) during the development and it made checking responsiveness over different screen sizes so much faster! Cool debugging features too.
-   At work: writing [[Redux]] selectors for the first time, to wire up new components on the front-end to get data from the backend. Selectors are basically functions that take in the latest state from the Redux store and will return us something based on that data. 

I shared my site on Twitter and the Gatsby.js retweeted it!
