### Code syntax highlighting

You can add code blocks with full syntax color highlighting by wrapping code snippet in triple backticks and specifying the type of the code (`js`, `rb`, `sh`, etc.):

```js
// Here's a bit of JavaScript:
console.log('hello!')
```

```rb
# And now some Ruby
def foo(bar)
  "baz"
end
```

```sh
$ cat /dev/urandom | grep "the answer to life" # shell scripts look nice too
```
