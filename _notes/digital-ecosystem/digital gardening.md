I first came across digital gardening when I took the [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/) course and I LOVED it. I was looking more into the profiles of the creators [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/) and [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/). Maggie had done the beautiful illustrations on the JJS course. 1) her website is *gorgeous* and 2) I noticed she had a digital garden. 

She describes it as: 
> a collection of imperfect notes, essays and ideas growing slowly over time

I love the concept of this
More messy

Especially great for sharing things that are less 'bloggy' - not enough for a full article
