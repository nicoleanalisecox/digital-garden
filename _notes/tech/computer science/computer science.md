The author Rob talks about how the physical universe can be viewed as being computed. 

> “The very nature of the physical universe describes a progressive system based on rules:
> - Cause and effect: what you and I think of as “conditional branching”
> - Consistent, repeated patterns and structure: the magical numbers pi, phi, and e (among others) hint at a design we can only perceive a part of. Indeed, Plato suggested that the world we see is just an abstraction of its true form.
> - Loops: the two ideas above (cause and effect, pattern repetition) interact repeatedly over time. A day is a repeated cycle of light and dark, life is the same way – as is a planet orbiting the sun, the sun orbiting the center of the galaxy.
>   
> This has the appearance of what we think of today as a program – either one massive one or many small ones interacting.”

After writing some code, for a running program you need a run loop which waits for an input and reason to exit, then a set of instructions that keeps on repeating until the exit is triggered. 

>“You type “node index.js” and a binary Big Bang goes off, bringing your small computational universe to life.”
