Computers used to be people not machines!

[[Algorithms]] have been around for a loooong time, but before they had to do things manually in order to use them. People called "computers" started to write the solutions to complex problems. Some of the problems back in the day might have been in the area of navigation, statistics or trajectory calculations for things like trebuchets. These were a "gigantic pile of numbers corresponding to various calculations that are relevant in some way". They would write the solutions down in books called Mathematical Tables. 

However, being human, this was prone to error.

So Charles Babbage comes along (he was a mathematician, philosopher and engineer) and was like hold up, enough of this humanness! This was during the Industrial revolution and he believed he could change mathematics by Ctrl + Alt + Deleting the human in routine calculations. 

He designed a mechanical computer that was run by a steam engine, called the Difference Engine. This thing could compute values of simple functions through a series of pulleys and gears set up in a particular way. The government gave him money but the project didn't get finished, and he came up with another idea instead, inspired by the Loom (used in textiles originally), which uses a load of pins moving up and down to direct the pattern to be made. He came up with the Analytical Engine, where he could tell the machine what to do by punching a series of holes in a card which would affect what gears would turn. ("An instruction set and the data to act on - a blueprint for the modern computer"). 

> “The programming language to be employed by users was akin to modern day assembly languages. Loops and conditional branching were possible, and so the language as conceived would have been Turing- complete as later defined by Alan Turing.”

He was focused on mathematical calculations, but then our babe Ada Lovelace comes along. She was a mathematician and helped with the translation of a talk Babbage gave. During the translation, she also added in her own notes and examples to clarify certain points. 

> “Ada Lovelace’s notes were labeled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.”

> “Besides Bernoulli’s numbers, she added this gem:
The Analytical Engine might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine…Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.”

A machine must be told what to do, and  can only compute what we tell it to compute. But we have limits, and so do computers! But theirs are much better than ours. 

Back in the day there were some clever people that thought about the idea of machine computation a lot. One of those people was Alonzo Church, who came up with [[Lambda Calculus]]. This was" symbolic calculus that any computer could use to compute anything", and was based on functions. 

Then Alan Turing came along and came up with a machine (the Turing Machine) that had a 'head' which could read and write to a tape that was infinitely long. Not only this but the head could use the information it reads from the tape to do calculations, including writing the calculations back onto the tape to do more calculations later. Calculation-ception. 

So these folks came up with machines and fancy maths to help us help machines to compute things. Fancy maths can also tell us what is possible to computer with a machine too, oooo how exciting!
