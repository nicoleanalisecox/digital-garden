Redux is a [[JavaScript]] library that helps with managing state in an application. 

[Three Redux Principles](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles):

1. The global state is stored in an object tree within a single store. 
2. State is read-only.
3. Changes are made with pure functions.
