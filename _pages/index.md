# welcome! ðŸ‘‹

<br>
This is my virtual corner of internet to embrace [[digital gardening]]. 

It's an ever-evolving networking of notes which is a continual work in progress, some areas may be a little messy and unrefined. 

These are the [[themes]] I either currently write about or want to write about along the way. 

Feel free to browse the links that spark your curiosity - the [[garden landscape ðŸŒ³]] might be a good place to start. 

You can look at the [[changelog]] to see what's been recently updated and added.
